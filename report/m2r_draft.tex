\section{Introduction}
%Henry
In this project we will trying to understand how a computer performs symbolic algebra. There already exist many packages that do this, such as sympy in Python, however to understand this fully we will be building our own symbolic package from scratch. Due to time constraints, we will only be covering differentiation and some simple simplification.\\
Firstly we looked at how a computer visualises inputs, in our case mathematical expressions, which it does using abstract syntax trees. Following this we explored various manipulations and functions on the abstract syntax tree and began building our package.

\section{Abstract Syntax Tree}
An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a tree representation of the code written in a programming language.\\
The term abstract is used since the tree is a high level representation of the code, ignoring some details of the code, such as parenthesis or spaces. These details are implicitely represented in the structure of the tree.\\
The term syntax is used because the tree represention needs to make sense on a syntax level, in this case the orders of the various components of the tree needs to be structurally correct and well defined.\\
The tree is a special data structure composed of nodes and edges. The top node, can be considered to be the 'trunk' of the tree, and everything else to be the 'branches' of the tree. This top node can also have several child node, which is turn can also have child nodes, and so on. The line segment connecting a node to its child is known as an edge. The trees that we will be looking at will be composed of nodes that are either operator nodes ( +, *,...) or terminals (symbols or numbers). The bottom nodes of the tree will always be terminals, while the rest will always be operator nodes. Operator nodes will always have children, while terminals never do. The operands are the expressions, symbols or number, in our case always 1 or 2, on which the operation is performed. All these terms can be more easely explained using an example.\\

\textbf{Examples:}\\[2mm]
\noindent
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
Consider 
\[y*(2+x)\]

The first thing we node is that the parenthesis from the expression are not represented in the tree, since these are implied by its structure.\\
The first node is *, an operator node, which has two children: $y$, a terminal, and +, another operator node. The operands of * are $y$ and $(x+2)$. The operator node + also has two child nodes: 2 and $x$, which in this case are also its operands.

\end{minipage}\\[2.5mm]

\noindent
Now, consider
\[2*x*\text{exp}(z)+(y**2)*\text{sin}(x/3-1)\]
\begin{center}

\end{center}
Note that the abstract syntax tree is quite complex, although its corresponding expression is relatively simple.\\[2.5mm]

\textbf{Parse Trees}\\
A parse tree, also known as a concrete syntax tree, is a more detailed version of the abstract syntax tree, in the sense that it represents everything in the code. For example, whereas the abstract syntax tree does not include parenthesis, the parse tree does.\\[2.5mm]

\textbf{Uses of abstract syntax trees}\\
The main use of abstract syntax trees is in compilers. A compiler is a program that transforms high level code into code that can be read by a computer. This process is know as compiling.
Often when a compiler begins compiling, it will create an abstract syntax trees from that language. \\[5cm]

\section{Object Oriented Programming \& Package}
%Aishy
Given the aims of our project, our first step was to simply create a program that would consider the Mathematical expression we inputted and find this as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that can both be displayed for a computer using the function repr() or for human reading it using str(). 

Using Python to help us create the program to do this, we soon discovered Object Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is a way to construct the relationships between various objects, in our case the nodes of the AST of the expression we have inputted. In our ASTs for each expression we had nodes and edges, through OOP we were able to assign specific properties for each node. These properties included a name, symbol and a priority. Since some nodes shared similar properties we, we were able to group certain objects into classes, where all objects falling in a certain class inherit the same properties. When an object is in an particular class we say it is an instance of the class. We started by creating a package called symbolic within which we created a Python module called node.py, where we stored all of our classes which our objects fall into and the methods associated with them. 

We started with a class called nodes, here we could state any properties that would be shared by all nodes and all the methods that were associated with this class. We then realised that all nodes fell into one of two categories: Operators or Terminals. These became our subclasses of node. Now first considering the subclass of operators we know that we have Unary operators such as exp(), -() or sin() and then binary operators such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, division and power. Each of these separate operators forms a subclass of UnaryOperator or BinaryOperator. An example would be the class Add which is a subclass of BinaryOperator. Therefore a node which performs the function add on its operands is an instance of the class nodes, therefore it inherits all properties of the class Add and also its parent class BinaryOperator and BinaryOperator’s parent class Operator and so on. Within the subclass Add we assign the symbol associated with this operation so it can be inherited by nodes that need to be added to other nodes, as these nodes would be objects within the Add class.

To account for the fact that $x + 2 = 2 + x$ for example, we had to introduce reverse operations and state when they would need to be applied instead of the usual \_\_add\_\_. In \_\_add\_\_ the first object is considered to be the self and the second object is the other. In \_\_radd\_\_ it is the opposite, therefore when we return Add(self, other) in \_\_radd\_\_ we are intact swapping the order of the operands in comparison with \_\_add\_\_. The module knew whether to use \_\_add\_\_ or \_\_radd\_\_ by checking whether other, that is our second operand, was a number as this is the only time where the order of operands in the output may need to be switched. We applied the same rules for other commutative operators such as multiply. 

Our other subclass of Nodes was the class Terminal, where we accounted for the most bottom children of our AST, that is nodes that don’t have their own operands. These can only be symbols or numbers so we set these up as the two sub-classes of Terminal. We let each object that was a symbol have a name and each each object that was a number have a value, these could be returned when calling upon self.name, where self is the node currently being considered. 

Within each class we can have magic methods. These are methods which are called upon and apply to all objects in that particular class. First of all we considered what methods all nodes would need to be able to do. Considering a regular node that could be an operator or a terminal, we know that it can be added, multiplied, divided, subtracted or taken to the power of another node. Therefore within the class of Node, our highest class, we can define all of these operations using magic methods. Magic method functions take in arguments self and other, where self is the node being considered and other is the node which it will be operated with. The syntax used to define such a magic method is def \_\_add\_\_(self, other): and then you state what needs to be done then this function is called, in this case return the class of Add(self,other) which tells the node to take the properties of this class which include assigning the appropriate symbol for the operator. 

Now considering the two subclasses of the class Operator, that is BinaryOperator and UnaryOperator, we know that an object within these classes would take operands, hence we initialised each of these classes giving each operands (two and one respectively) and a name. We did this by calling on the magic method \_\_init\_\_. We also defined the method of returning this section of the expression in string form using \_\_str\_\_ for a person to be able to read it as during the process of going through the classes the expression is stored in object form. Although we have to initialise both classes, we could not do this in the parent class Operator since in UnaryOperator and BinaryOperator a different number of operands need to be considered. If we had instead defined it in the parent class it would automatically be inherited by both subclasses and therefore have the wrong number of operands for one of the subclasses.

\section{Differentiation}
%Fan
A key part of our project is to observe how a computer implements certain mathematical processes. Importantly, we wanted to see how a computer differentiates analytically. \\
To do this, we built a module, \texttt{differentiate.py}, that uses our \texttt{node.py} and \texttt{visitor.py} modules we built previously. This module contains a general differentiation function (\texttt{diff}), which takes as its arguments the expression we want to differentiate (\texttt{expr}) and the variable we want to differentiate with respect to (\texttt{symbol}). Here, both arguments are either objects defined by the classes of \texttt{node.py},
or objects from the class \texttt{Number} (the standard Python class for number objects) which we renamed to \texttt{Numberclass} to avoid confusion.\\
This function (\texttt{diff}) is a higher order function defined using a single dispatch visitor function \texttt{diff\_visitor} and the \texttt{post\_traversal} function from the visitor module.
A single dispatch function is a function that acts differently according to the class type of one of its variables. For \texttt{diff\_visitor}, we only care about the class type of the first variable, \texttt{node}.
We call this function a visitor since it will visit each node in the syntax tree, from the top to the bottom, as defined by \texttt{post\_traversal}, and perform the relevant differentiation rule at that node.
We do this by adding a register for the different class types that \texttt{node} can be (i.e. Add, Terminal, Neg) and use the various rules of differentiation that we know (i.e. Product, Addition, etc.).
